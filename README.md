# DriveProject
A mobile game made in Unity3D.

This is a simple game to portray my progress in my game development journey. At the moment of writing this (09/02/2023) this is my most advanced project given the features that I included in the game by myself; this includes things like:

- Difficulty selector
- Model Selector
- Other features

Although the the level design and most of the features in the game are my idea, this game wouldn't have been possible without [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/); this is their idea/project. They have been my mentors in this journey, and I want not only to thank them, but of course to credit them for this game. The tutor during this project is [Nathan Ferrer, AKA "Dapper Dino"](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-farrer-1406b0168/?originalSubdomain=uk).

In short, the general concpet of the game is **GameDev.TV's**, and this is my own **modified** version of the game with my own added features.

- **AS FOR 2020-2023, THE GAMES IN MY GITHUB PAGE ARE THE RESULTS OF MY OWN MODIFIED VERSIONS OF GAMEDEV.TV'S ORIGINAL VERSION OF THEIR GAMES.**
